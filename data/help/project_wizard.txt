New Project with the "New Project Wizard"

1. You can create a new project by going to File -> New Project Wizard.

2. Two buttons on the left pane allow you to import a single image files or all 
    files within a directory.

3. The pane on the right contains the Object Class Manager.  Use the text box 
    to name the object class and click the "Add Class" button to add it to the 
    project.  You can also rename and remove object classes. If you want to 
    change the color, click on the colored box next to the class and a popup 
    dialog will appear to change the color.

4. After the classes and files have been added to the project, you can click
    the green button which will build the project.  Follow Steps 5-8 in the
    "Starting a New Project" tutorial to begin your annotation effort.
