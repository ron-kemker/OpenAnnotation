Exporting Project to CSV

Once the project is completly annotated, you'll want to be able to do something
with it.  Right now, the project can be exported to Comma Separated Value (CSV)
file format.  This can be opened up in Microsoft Excel or other software
languages, e.g., Python has a csv reader/writer capability:

To export the project that is currently open, click "File -> Export to CSV" and
pick where you want to save the file using the popup dialog box.

Each row corresponds to a single bounding box in the project. The format for 
each row in the CSV file is:

    filename, label, x0, y0, x1, y1, rotation
