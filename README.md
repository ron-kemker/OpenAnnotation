## Current Version: 0.1 (Beta Release)
- Projects support multi-class bounding box annotation
- Export projects to CSV (for future use)

Disclaimer: This software should be considered "unstable", i.e., there will be bugs.  I am currently building test cases for all of my code so that I can maintain a "stable" branch that is well tested and an "unstable" branch that will include new updates more quickly.
