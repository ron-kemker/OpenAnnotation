Starting a New Project

1. You can create a new project by going to File -> New Project.

2. Add images by clicking on "File -> Import File" (to add a single image) or 
    "File -> Import Directory" (to add all images in a single directory).

3. Open the Object Class Manager for the project by clicking "Tools -> Class 
    Manager".  A popup window will appear.

4. Use the text box to name the object class and click the "Add Class" button
    to add it to the project.  You can also rename and remove object classes.
    If you want to change the color, click on the colored box next to the class
    and a popup dialog will appear to change the color.

5. After the classes have been added to the project, there should be a dropdown
    menu to select which object class to draw a bounding box for.  

6. After selecting the corresponding class, click (and hold) on the image where
    one of the corners should be drawn and drag the cursor to where the opposite
    corner should be located.  Release the mouse button to draw the box.

7. You can click and drag the box edges to move them in-and-out to modify the
    bounding box.

8. You can use the left and right arrows to navigate through the project and
    annotate the remaining images. Make sure to save the project in "File ->
    Save" to work on it later.
