# OpenAnnotation
Open-Source Annotation Tool for Computer Vision Projects
 
By [Ronald Kemker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronald-kemker-66250b115)

## Current Version: 0.1 (Beta Release)
- Projects support multi-class bounding box annotation
- Export projects to CSV (for future use)

Disclaimer: This software should be considered "unstable", i.e., there will be bugs.  I am currently building test cases for all of my code so that I can maintain a "stable" branch that is well tested and an "unstable" branch that will include new updates more quickly.

## Library Dependencies
See [setup.py](https://github.com/ron-kemker/OpenAnnotation/blob/main/setup.py) for details

## Future Work
Follow the [project milestones](https://github.com/ron-kemker/OpenAnnotation/milestones) page to keep track of my plans going forward.
